## Hey there, I'm [Rylan](https://guns.lol/rylanfoxins)!
I am a semi-small content creator that is on both YouTube and TikTok. The use of this GitHub currently is very limited, but I plan on doing more with it as I go on. I'm slowly trying to learn C#, but there is no guarentee and I am mostly focusing on more important things like schoolwork. Thanks for visiting my profile!

Extra things about me: All I'm good at is README's
